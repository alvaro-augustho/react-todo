React Todo

This is an application in React aimed at writing and mantaining a simple todo list for an user. All the data is stored at the client, and there is no persistence.

I wrote this program first in pure React, some time ago. Now I am migrating it to use Redux, a state container for Javascript apps. I think this is worth the effort because the code will become much simpler to create new features, 
maintain the existent ones, and for more testability.
